# HDRestore
HDRestore copies files from an old unreliable hard drive to a new hard drive. This program differs from other recovery software because this program will simply copy what files are available. Where the windows builtin copy function will simply fail mid copy, HDRestore will keep track of what files are copied and and continue skipping the last file that failed.
